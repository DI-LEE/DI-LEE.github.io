Welcome to my website! I am an integrated M.S./Ph.D. student in the [Computer Vision Lab (KUAICV)](https://cvlab.korea.ac.kr) at [Korea University](https://www.korea.ac.kr), advised by Prof. **Sangpil Kim**. I am currently a **visiting scholar at Purdue University**, collaborating with Prof. **Karthik Ramani** at the **Convergence Design Lab**.

My research interests lie in **3D computer vision**, especially in:
- 3D/4D reconstruction and scene editing  
- Human-object interaction  
- 3D watermarking

Outside of research, I love playing soccer, workout, traveling. I enjoy learning new things beyond my research area.

If you're interested in collaborating or would like to learn more about my research, feel free to connect!
