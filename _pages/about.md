Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Vision Lab (KUAICV)](https://kuaicv.com/) at [Korea University](https://www.korea.edu/sites/en/index.do), advised by [Prof. Sangpil Kim](https://kuaicv.com/professor/?theme=pub/antoniau0026hide_banners=true). 

I am currently a **visiting scholar at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/)**, collaborating with [Prof. Karthik Ramani](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ramani/wordpress/) at the [Convergence Design Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/cdesign/wp/).

My research interests lie in **3D computer vision**, especially in:
- 3D/4D scene editing and reconstruction
- Human-object interaction  
- AI watermarking

Outside of research, I enjoy playing soccer, working out, and traveling. I also love learning new things beyond my research area. I'm also a big fan of Arsenal.

If you're interested in collaboration or would like to learn more about my research, feel free to connect!
